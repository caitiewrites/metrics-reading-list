Resources on best practices for designing metrics and how to store the data for those metrics.

# Selecting good metrics

# Behavioural targeting

* [Behavior Design](http://captology.stanford.edu/projects/behaviordesign.html) Stanford's Persuasive Tech Lab has a number of key resources on behavior design including:
    * **[Behavior Wizard](http://captology.stanford.edu/projects/behavior-wizard-2.html)** A method for matching target behaviors with solutions for achieving those behaviors.
